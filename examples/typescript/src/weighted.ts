/**
 * Example for Weighted Voting.
 *
 * Weighted voting is a voting model where the weight of some participants' votes is greater than others.
 *
 * The process creation anb use of the ballot protocol is the same as on any other Election, the key difference is the
 * use of a `WeightedCensus` instead of a `PlainCensus`.
 *
 * Note that Contrary to quadratic voting, the `costFromWeight` attribute in the vote type needs to be set to false or
 * left undefined in this context.
 *
 * Essentially, you can use the SDK for any vote type except quadratic voting (which already uses the weighted census
 * but for different objectives).
 * The votes are stored on the blockchain like any other voting process. When the results are retrieved from the API,
 * the indexer applies the weight to every vote, and this reflects in the results matrix.
 *
 * For instance, consider that 4 voters have to vote on the question: "Do you like chocolate?" with possible answers "yes" and "no".
 * The weight distribution and votes are as follows:
 *
 * - Voter 1: Weight = 1, Votes for option 0 (no), hence adds 1 vote.
 * - Voter 2: Weight = 2, Votes for option 1 (yes), hence adds 2 votes.
 * - Voter 3: Weight = 3, Votes for option 0 (no), hence adds 3 votes.
 * - Voter 4: Weight = 4, Votes for option 1 (yes), hence adds 4 votes.
 *
 * The total weight is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` and will be distributed among the choices.
 *
 * The results array will return by the API should look like:
 *
 * ```
 * [ [ '4', '6' ] ]
 * ```
 *
 * Here, for option 0 (no): `1 + 3 = 4` and for option 1 (yes): `2 + 4 = 6`.

/**
 * The process of generate a `WeightedCensus` is similar to create a `PlainCensus` with the difference that you have to
 * add the vote weight to every participant. As shown below, we are giving to each voter a weight associated to its
 * position on an array. For 4 voters, the first one will have a weight of 1, and the last will have 4.
